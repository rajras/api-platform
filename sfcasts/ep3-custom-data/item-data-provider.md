# Custom Item Data Provider

We've successfully used our collection data provider to populate the `isMe` field
on each `User` resource returned by the *collection* operation:

[[[ code('9c70dfb4d7') ]]]

If we go to `/api/users.jsonld`, we see it!

But if we go to an individual item, we get this error... because the `isMe` field is
*not* being set yet. We can also see this in our tests - the `testGetUser()` method
looks for the `isMe` field on an *item* endpoint. Try it:

```terminal
symfony php bin/phpunit --filter=testGetUser
```

And this should fail with the same error as the browser. Hmm, it *does* fail...
but not *quite* like I expected. Ah, I need to make my test smarter. Before checking
the JSON, add `$this->assertResponseStatusCodeSame(200)`:

[[[ code('27729e6f51') ]]]

Now when we try the test:

```terminal-silent
symfony php bin/phpunit --filter=testGetUser
```

Yes! It *was* failing with the same 500 error... and now it's more obvious.

Anyways, to make this test pass, we *also* need to populate the `isMe` field when
a *single* `User` is fetched. Yep, we have a *collection* data provider, now we
need an *item* data provider.

You can do this in a separate class, but it's totally fine to put both
providers in the same file.

## Creating the Item Data Provider

Add a third interface called - wait for this mouthful -
`DenormalizedIdentifiersAwareItemDataProviderInterface`:

[[[ code('0e87d61d2e') ]]]

Wow. If you jump into this class, it extends a less strict
`ItemDataProviderInterface`. I'm implementing that other crazy interface because
that's what the *core* Doctrine item data provider uses... and I want to be able
to pass it the same arguments.

Ok: go to the "Code"->"Generate" menu - or `Command`+`N` on a Mac - and implement the
one method we need: `getItem()`:

[[[ code('d78e37c687') ]]]

Then let's *immediately* inject the core Doctrine item provider. Add the new
argument: `ItemDataProviderInterface $itemDataProvider`. Hit `Alt`+`Enter` to
initialize that property and then... because I'm a bit obsessive about order,
I'll make sure this is the *second* property:

[[[ code('e6deaf09cc') ]]]

Finally, down in `getItem()`, return `$this->itemDataProvider->getItem()` - yes,
I *totally* just forgot the `itemDataProvider` part, I'll catch that in a second -
and pass this `$resourceClass`, `$id`, `$operationName` and also `$context`:

[[[ code('6c17eb7ca6') ]]]

To tell Symfony to *specifically* pass us the *Doctrine* item provider, go back to
`services.yaml`: we need to add one more bind. The name of the argument is
`$itemDataProvider` - so I'll copy that - and that should be passed the *same*
service id as above, but with the name "item". If you used `debug:container`,
that's what you would see:

[[[ code('8b579f7997') ]]]

Beautiful! Before we try this, let's jump straight in and set the `isMe` field.
To do that, instead of returning, add `$item =` and I'll - as usual - put some
phpdoc above this because *we* know this will be a `User` object or null:

[[[ code('f21092f4a9') ]]]

It will be `null` if the id wasn't found in the database. To prevent that being a
problem, if not, `$item`, then, return null:

[[[ code('c5fac3b9c8') ]]]

At this point, we *know* we have a `User` object. So we can say
`$item->setIsMe()` `$this->security->getUser() === $item`. Finish by returning
`$item` at the bottom:

[[[ code('2eed6337f8') ]]]

Ok! We're ready to try the test:

```terminal-silent
symfony php bin/phpunit --filter=testGetUser
```

And... ah! Recursion! The problem is coming from line 43 of `UserDataProvider`.
That's the dummy mistake I made a few minutes ago: add `itemDataProvider->`
and *then* `getItem()`:

[[[ code('c029dba2fc') ]]]

Come on Ryan!

Now when we try it:

```terminal-silent
symfony php bin/phpunit --filter=testGetUser
```

Green! Congrats team! We just added a custom `isMe` field that is returned on
both the item and collection operations *and* is properly documented.

## Don't Forget Populating in the Data Persister

But... surprise! There is *one* last spot where the data is missing! Open
`UserResourceTest` and go to the top: the first test is about creating a user.
Copy that method name and run the tests with `--filter=testCreateUser`:

```terminal-silent
symfony php bin/phpunit --filter=testCreateUser
```

Ah! A 500 error! Apparently the `isMe` field in *this* `User` object is never
set!

And... if you *think* about it... that makes sense! This is the *one* situation
where the data provider system is never called! It's called when you load a
collection of items or a single item, but when you're creating a *new* item,
there was never anything to load!

The fix for this is to *also* make sure that we set this field in the data persister.
At the top, add one more argument - `Security $security` - and then initialize that
property:

[[[ code('60a1a5d2c7') ]]]

Below, in `persist()` -  we could add the logic in the if statement where we *know*
this is a new item - but it doesn't hurt to set it every time a `User` is saved.
Add `$data->setIsMe($this->security->getUser() === $data)`:

[[[ code('379eac87e6') ]]]

Try the test now:

```terminal-silent
symfony php bin/phpunit --filter=testCreateUser
```

We got it!

What we just did is a really natural way to use entities in API Platform... but
*also* have the flexibility to add custom fields that require a service to set their
value.

But, I admit, it's not the *easiest* thing. This required both a collection *and*
item data provider... and we also needed to add the same code in a data persister.

What I *love* about this solution is that the field isn't really *custom*: it's
a *real* field that we add to our ApiResource class. The *tricky* part is *populating*
that field. And it turns out, there are several *other* ways to do this, which
might be better depending on the situation. Let's talk about those next.
