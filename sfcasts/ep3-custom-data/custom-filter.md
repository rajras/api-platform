# Custom Filter, getDescription() & properties

On `CheeseListing`, thanks to `SearchFilter` and also `BooleanFilter` and
`RangeFilter`, when we use the collection endpoint, there are a number
of different ways that we can filter, like searching the `title`, `description`
and `owner` fields:

[[[ code('f5f916d70c') ]]]

That's pretty cool!

Except, we can only search by *one* field at a time. Like, we can search for
something in the `title` *or* something in the `description` but we can't, for
example, say `?search=` and have that automatically search across multiple fields.

But hey! That's no huge issue: when the built-in filters aren't enough, just make
your *own*. Creating custom filters is both fun and... weird! Let's go!

## Creating the Filter Class

Over in `src/`, how about in `ApiPlatform`, create a new PHP class called
`CheeseSearchFilter`. As usual, this will need to implement an interface or
extend some base class. In this case, we need to extend `AbstractFilter`. Make
sure you get the one from Doctrine `ORM`... it's actually impossible to see which
one we have here... so I'll randomly guess:

[[[ code('b573220752') ]]]

Hey! I got it! If you chose the wrong one, you'll have to delete your project and
start over. Or... just delete this *one* line and manually say `use AbstractFilter`
to get the *right* one.

It turns out, creating a filter is *different* based on the underlying data
source. If your underlying data source is Doctrine ORM, creating a filter
will look one way. But if your underlying data source is, for example,
`ElasticSearch` - which is something API Platform has built-in support for - then
a custom filter will look different. And if you have a *completely* custom API
resource like `DailyStats`, creating a custom filter looks even *another* way.

We'll talk about how to create a custom filter for `DailyStats` in a few minutes.

When we extend `AbstractFilter`, as you can see, we need to implement a couple of
methods. Go to "Code"->"Generate" - or `Command` + `N` on a Mac - and select
"Implement Methods" to generate the two methods we need:

## Checking out Core Filters: PropertyFilter

Filters are ultimately two parts: they're the logic that *does* the filtering,
which is `filterProperty()`, and then the logic that *describes* how the filter
works, which is used in the documentation. That's the job of `getDescription()`.

Let's start there. To help fill in this method, let's cheat and look at some core
classes. Hit `Shift`+`Shift` and look for `PropertyFilter.php`. Make sure to
include non-project items. Open that up.

As a reminder, `PropertyFilter` is an odd filter that is used to return less
*fields* on each result. That's different than *most* filters whose job is to
return less *items* in the collection.

In `PropertyFilter`, search for `getDescription()`.

Excellent! So what `getDescription()` returns is an array of the query parameters
that can be used to *activate* this filter. And under each one, we set a bunch of
array keys that are ultimately used to generate documentation for that query
parameter.

Unfortunately, nobody likes random arrays like this. And honestly, the best way to
see *what* keys we should fill-in is by checking out these core classes.

## Checking out Core Filters: SearchFilter

Close this filter and let's open one more: hit `Shift`+`Shift` and look for
`SearchFilter.php`... and make sure to include non-project items.

In this case, `getDescription()` actually lives in `SearchFilterTrait`.
Hold Command or `Control` and click to open up that.

This returns the *exact* same structure, except that it's a bit more complex.
It says `$properties = $this->getProperties();` and loops over those to create
the same array structure we saw earlier - with one query param per property.

In `CheeseListing`, when you use `SearchFilter`, you can pass it a `properties`
option that says:

> I want this `SearchFilter` to work on all 4 of these properties

[[[ code('0bfd738c01') ]]]

What that effectively does is create *four* different possible query parameters
that you can use. And so the `getDescription()` method returns an array with
4 items in it.

Close up those core classes.

## The $this->properties Property

Now because we're extending `AbstractFilter`, one of the properties we magically
have access to is `$this->properties`. Let's `dd()` that here so we can see what
it looks like: `dd($this->properties)`:

[[[ code('ad7c2c902b') ]]]

Back at the browser, open a new tab and go to `/api/cheeses.jsonld`. But
we won't hit the dump yet. Why? Because we haven't told API Platform that we want
our `CheeseListing` to *use* this filter.

## Using the Filter on the Resource

How do we do that? We already know how! Back in `CheeseListing`, we've done this
before with other filters. Anywhere in here, add `@ApiFilter()` with
`CheeseSearchFilter::class`:

[[[ code('55be75fe55') ]]]

Unfortunately, PhpStorm doesn't auto-complete that for me... so I'll copy the class
name and add it on top manually: `use App\ApiPlatform\CheeseSearchFilter`:

[[[ code('ab91941cae') ]]]

As *soon* as we do this, when we refresh the endpoint, *even* though I don't have
any query parameters in the URL... it *does* hit `getDescription()`! Why? Because
in JSON-LD Hydra, the filter documentation is part of the response.

Apparently, `$this->properties` is null. Here is where - and when - `$this->properties`
comes into play. Often - and as we've seen - you can pass *which* properties you
want a filter to operate on.

For example, if we wanted *our* filter to be configurable, we could say
`properties =` and pass it `price`... or an array of fields:

[[[ code('4666c447c1') ]]]

As *soon* as we have this, when we refresh: we get `price` in the array! So if
you want the *properties* on your filter to be configurable, *that* is the purpose
of `$this->properties`.

Now, in *our* case, we're creating this filter *entirely* for a single class for
*our* application. So we *don't* need to worry about making it configurable.
Remove the `properties` option from the annotation:

[[[ code('b0d71bf986') ]]]

We're going to completely ignore `$this->properties`... and do whatever we want.

Next, we *now* know enough to fill in `getDescription()` for our filter. Once we've
done that, we'll bring it to life!
