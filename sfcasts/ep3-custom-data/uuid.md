# UUID's

Let's add a *bonus* feature to our app. Right now, the id of each resource is its
auto-increment database ID. We can see this on all of our endpoints. If you Execute
the cheese collection endpoint... the IRIs are `/api/cheeses/1`. You'll also use
the database id to update or do anything else.

Using auto-increment id's like this is *fine*. But it *can* have a few downsides.
For example, it can expose some info - like how *many* users you have...
or - by just changing the ids to 1, 2 or 3, you could easily browse through *all*
of the users... though you should - ya know - use *security* to avoid this if
it's a problem.

Auto-increment IDs have another downside: when you use an auto-increment
database id as the key in your API, it means that *only* your *server* can create
them. But if your API clients - like JavaScript - could *instead* choose
their *own* id, it would actually simplify their lives. Think about it:
if you're creating a new resource in JavaScript, you normally need to send the
AJAX call and wait for the response so that you can *then* use the new id.
That's especially common with frontend frameworks when managing state.

Another option is to use a UUID: a, sort of, randomly-generated string that *anyone* -
including JavaScript - can create. If we allowed that, our *JavaScript* could
generate that UUID, send the AJAX request *with* that UUID and then not have to
wait for the response to update the state.

## Installing ramsey/uuid

So that's our next mission: replace the auto-increment id with a UUID in our API
so that API clients have the *option* to generate the id themselves. We'll do
this for our `User` resource.

So... how *do* we generate these UUID strings? Symfony 5.2 will come with a
new UUID component, which should allow us to easily generate UUID's and store them
in Doctrine. But since that hasn't been released yet, we can use `ramsey/uuid`,
which is honestly awesome and has been around for a long time. Also, Ben Ramsey
is a *really* nice dude and an old friend from Nashville. Ben generates the *best*
UUIDs.

Find your terminal and run:

```terminal
composer require ramsey/uuid-doctrine
```

The actual library that generate UUID's is `ramsey/uuid`. The library *we're*
installing *requires* that, but also adds a new UUID doctrine *type*.

This will execute a recipe from the contrib repository so make sure you say "yes"
to that or yes permanently. I committed before I ran `composer require`, so we
can see the changes with:

```terminal
git status
```

Ok: it modified the normal files, but *also* added a configuration file. Let's
go check that out: `config/packages/ramsey_uuid_doctrine.yaml`.

## The UUID Doctrine Type

Ah! *This* adds the new UUID Doctrine type I was talking about. What this
allows us to do - back in `User` - is add a new property - private `$uuid` -
and, above this, say `@ORM\Column()` with `type="uuid"`. That would *not* have
worked before we installed that library and got the new config file. Also set
this to `unique=true`.

UUID's are strings, but the `uuid` type will make sure to store the UUID in the
*best* possible way for whatever database system you're using. And when we query,
it will turn that string *back* into a UUID *object*, which is ultimately what's
stored on this property. You'll see that in a minute.

Could we know *remove* the auto-increment column and make *this* the primary
key in Doctrine? Yes, you *could*. But I won't. Why? Some databases - like MySQL -
have performance problems with foreign keys when your primary key is a string.
PostgreSQL does *not* have this problem, so do whatever is best for you. But there's
no real disadvantage to having the auto-increment primary key, but a UUID as
your *API* identifier.

## Generating a Safe Migration

Ok: we added a new property. So let's generate the migration for it. Find your
terminal and run:

```terminal
symfony console make:migration
```

Let's go check that out. Go into the `migrations/` directory... and open the
latest file. Since I'm using MySQL, you can see that it's storing this as a
`char` field with a length of 36.

The only tricky thing is that because we *do* already have a database with
users in it - the fact that this column is `NOT NULL` will make the migration
fail because the existing records will have *no* value.

To fix this, temporarily change it to `DEFAULT NULL`. Then, right after this,
say `$this->addSql()` with `UPDATE user SET uuid = UUID()`. That's a MySQL
function to generate UUID's.

Let's try this! Back at your terminal, run the migration:

```terminal
symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

It works! Now generate *one* more migration as a lazy way to set the field *back*
to `NOT NULL`:

```terminal-silent
symfony console make:migration
```

If you look at the new migration... perfect! This changes `uuid` from
`DEFAULT NULL` to `NOT NULL`. Run the migrations one last time:

```terminal-silent
symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

## Auto-Setting the UUID

Got it! So at this point, we have a new column... but nobody is using it. Let's
run the user tests:

```terminal
symfony php bin/phpunit tests/Functional/UserResourceTest.php
```

And... ah! It explodes like crazy! Of course: column uuid cannot be null. It's
required in the database... but we're never setting it.

Unlike an auto-increment ID, the UUID is *not* automatically set, which is fine.
We can set it *ourselves* in the constructor. Scroll down... we already have
a constructor. Add `$this->uuid = Uuid` - auto-complete the one from
`Ramsey\` - then call `uuid4()`, which is how you get a *random* UUID string.

Run the tests again:

```terminal-silent
symfony php bin/phpunit tests/Functional/UserResourceTest.php
```

*Now* they're happy!

Next, the UUID is *not* part of our API at *all* yet. Let's tell API Platform
to start using *it* as the identifier.
