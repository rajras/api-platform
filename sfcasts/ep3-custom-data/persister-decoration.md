# Data Persister Decoration

In the last course, we create this `UserDataPersister` class:

[[[ code('8afac30e1f') ]]]

## Um, what is a "Persister"?

Now, let's back up real quick. Whenever you use a `POST` or `PUT` endpoint, after
ApiPlatform deserializes the data into an object and validates it, it tries
to *save* or *persist* that object. Usually, this means that we're saving an entity
object to the database via Doctrine. But we could "save" an object anywhere, like
by sending the data to *another* API, or putting it into Redis or ElasticSearch.
ApiPlatform doesn't really care. These "things that save the object" are called
"data persisters".

So far, our two API resources - `CheeseListing` and `User` - are both entities...
and ApiPlatform has special support for Doctrine, *including* a core Doctrine
data persister. So whenever we make a `POST`, `PUT` or also `PATCH` request to
an ApiResource that is an entity, that core Doctrine data persister jumps into
action and saves the object to the database. This means that *normally* we don't
need to create our *own* data persister: the core one calls `persist()` and
`flush()` for us.

## Taking Action Before/After Save

But what if you need to *do* something right before or after an item is saved
to the database? Well, you *could* use a Doctrine listener for that... but if you
want that code to only run in the context of your API, how can we? The answer
is to create a custom data persister. For example, we created `UserDataPersister`
because we needed to encode the plain password and set it onto the `password`
field before saving:

[[[ code('23b81c7548') ]]]

To create this data persister, we implemented `DataPersisterInterface` and added
a `supports()` method that says that we support `User` objects:

[[[ code('c91cb51635') ]]]

As *soon* as we did that, *we* became *100%* responsible for persisting `User` objects.
What I mean is, the normal, *core* Doctrine data persister will *no* longer be called
for `User` objects: our persister takes precedence. This is why we did our custom
work up here, but then had to call `persist()` and `flush()` at the bottom:

[[[ code('73d0976420') ]]]

To prove that our data persister *replaces* the core persister for `User` objects,
let's comment-out the `persist()` call and run our tests:

[[[ code('21cec1024a') ]]]

Open `tests/Functional/UserResourceTest`. This `testCreateUser()` method *should* now
fail because the User won't *actually* be saved to the database:

[[[ code('e964960c4c') ]]]

Copy that method name and run:

```terminal
symfony run bin/phpunit --filter=testCreateUser
```

And... yea! It failed! This test passed a minute ago, but now we get a 400
bad request... which happens because the un-persisted entity is missing an `id`...
and so ApiPlatform has trouble serializing it.

If we put the `persist()` back:

[[[ code('87b1058a86') ]]]

And run the test again:

```terminal-silent
symfony run bin/phpunit --filter=testCreateUser
```

All better!

## Decorating the Core Persister

So the fact that we are now *entirely* responsible for persisting the object is...
not really that big of a deal. But it would be even *better* if we could do our
custom work up here... and then just call the *core* data persister so that *it*
can do its normal logic.

And that's totally possible via decoration. Yep, instead of injecting the
entity manager into the constructor, replace this with `DataPersisterInterface`
and call it, how about, `$decoratedDataPersister`:

[[[ code('f5910e75e9') ]]]

Copy that and rename the variable and the `$entityManager` property to
`$decoratedDataPersister`:

[[[ code('082134fa77') ]]]

This is nice because, down here, instead `persist()` and `flush()`, all we need
is `$this->decoratedDataPersister->persist($data)`:

[[[ code('a39184e310') ]]]

Down in `remove()`, we can do the same: `$this->decoratedDataPersister->remove($data)`:

[[[ code('56514e7eb3') ]]]

Beautiful! But... before we try this... um... *don't* try this unless you have Xdebug
installed. Because... when I run my test:

```terminal-silent
symfony run bin/phpunit --filter=testCreateUser
```

Ah! It's recursion!

> Maximum function nesting level of 256 reached

Ok, let's figure out what's going on. In the constructor, we just said
`DataPersisterInterface` and Symfony, apparently, figured out what to pass us:

[[[ code('f8291f2266') ]]]

This means that the data persister must be passed via autowiring.

Let's go get more info about that autowired service. Run:

```terminal
php bin/console debug:autowiring Persister
```

And... here it is! This is an alias for some service called
`debug.api_platform.data_persister`. Ok! Let's find more info about *that*
service:

```terminal
php bin/console debug:container debug.api_platform.data_persister
```

Ok: the class name is `TraceableChainDataPersister`. The *key* word in the name
is "chain". If we dug a few levels deeper, we would find out that the data
persister service *actually* holds a *collection* of data persisters inside of it!

Basically, whenever something needs to be persisted, ApiPlatform calls `persist()`
on this *one* data persister. Internally, *it* then loops over the persisters
inside, calls `supports()` on each one:

[[[ code('28004aeda9') ]]]

And then calls `persist()` on the first persister that supports the object.

So... this is really cool! If you need the *entire* data persister system, you
can autowire this one service and call `persist()` on it.

The *problem* is that we are *effectively* calling ourselves! ApiPlatform
originally calls persist on the `ChainDataPersister`, it calls `persist()` on us...
and then we call `persist()` back on the `ChainDataPersister`:

[[[ code('479ae7db13') ]]]

Whoops!

So instead of injecting the *entire* data persister system, let's
inject and use just the *one* data persister that we know we want: the one that is
*normally* used to save entities. We'll do that next and learn more about how
the data persister system is different than some other parts of ApiPlatform,
like the context builder system.
